        <p>In the months after the February 2021 military coup in Myanmar, human rights in the country deteriorated, according to a recent <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/05/myanmar-military-onslaught-in-eastern-states-amounts-to-collective-punishment/" target="_blank">Amnesty International report</a> that accused state forces of crimes against humanity. An analysis of a <a href="https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/" targe="_blank">crowd-sourced database</a> of conflicts worldwide showed that over the past year, military and police forces in Myanmar have attacked, sexually assaulted and abducted women on at least 88 different occasions resulting in 55 deaths, the most out of any country. The violence is ongoing -- nearly half of these events have taken place within the past five months. </p>

        <p>Most of Myanmar's violence against women has consisted of physical attacks, including torturing and killing civillians. There have been 14 accounts of state forces raping women and six accounts of taking women hostage or using them as human shields.</p>
        <p>“The world’s attention may have moved away from Myanmar since last year’s coup, but civilians continue to pay a high price," said Rawya Rageh in Amensty International's recent report. Rageh is a senior crisis adviser who spent months interviewing dozens of people in Myanmar. "The military’s ongoing assault on civilians in eastern Myanmar has been widespread and systematic, likely amounting to crimes against humanity.”</p>
        <p>According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Database, over the past year more than 1,500 civilians have died at the hands of the country's military.</p>
